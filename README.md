# Pytorch
My path to learning about pytorch


After some research when trying to get into machine learning I found that pytorch is very important part of the process. This is also a good way to enter in deep learning later down the road. 
This will be my first steps into machine learning/deep learning with the end goal of being a machine learning engineer.
