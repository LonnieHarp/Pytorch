For the set up I will be using a local set up via vs code. To get ready for pytorch use I'll need to do some things.

* keep in mind that all pip installs will be made inside of the terminal of vs code,
    or inside of the cmd prompt (You can also make these inside of anaconda cmd prompt). 

1. download needed files
    - anaconda
    - pytorch
    - numpy
    - pandas
    - nvidia cuda toolkit (for use of an amd gpu this may differ)
    - python

first download anaconda and then open the command prompt and enter the following commands:
1. Install the latest version of cuda. You can find this command on pytorch website https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ 
    This will take some time go make a sandwich. 
    - Check if cuda is install properly go to a python script (or .ipynb file) and and run
        import torch
        torch.cuda.is_available()


once you have these ready you will be able to use the pip installer
go into vs code and in the terminal type in these commands to get started.
** note that you may need to do this in powershell if on windows. 
1. pip install torch
2. pip install numpy
3. pip install pandas
4. pip install Matplotlib 
These all can be copy and paste

So I can save all the images to one file and call them to any file
    import *notebook name* as *whatever*

To have the use of accuracy one easy way to do it is 
pip install torchmetrics
